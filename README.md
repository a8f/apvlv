# apvlv

apvlv is a Vim-like PDF/EPUB Viewer for Linux/Windows.

apvlv is open source software created by Alf and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/naihe2010/apvlv). It is still growing today.

apvlv allows people to read their PDF/EPUB files using commands they are familiar with from Vim. For example, \<Ctrl-f\> for next page, \<Ctrl-b\> for previous page, 'k', 'j', 'h', and 'l' for scrolling a page up, down, left or right, and so on. It also supports prefixing commands with numbers to run the command that many times. For example, typing '50' and \<Ctrl-f\> will go forward 50 pages, typing '30' and \<Ctrl-b\> will go back 30 pages.

apvlv also supports opening directories in the same way as PDF/EPUB files. When a directory is open, 'k' and 'j' navigate up and down, 'h' and 'l' collapse and expand directories, and 't' opens the selected document in a new tab.
